        body: "Mental health awareness is not only about raising awareness for the recognition of mental health, it’s also about advocating for our own awareness and acceptance of it. \n\n When I first sensed I may have depression, I held off seeing a specialist, believing that I could just have conversations with myself, talk myself back to health. Surely, I’m not so weak as needing someone to help me think? Surely, as my mum often tells me, I just need to “get over it”? \n\n As you may expect, it didn’t quite work. \n\n The despondency and emptiness got worse, the tears became more intense and more frequent, and the thoughts got darker. There was so much pain that it felt like death was the only answer. I started staring out of glass windows of the office building, wishing I could just jump out of it. I started crossing roads recklessly hoping I could get hit by a bus. \n\n That was when I realised I needed help. \n\n I was diagnosed with severe depression in 2019. It was largely work- induced but, inevitably, childhood trauma amplified matters. \n\n At first, the GP pointed me to the organisation Mind, who set up an appointment between myself and a CBT - qualified counsellor. I could not say it was helpful in the slightest. We met in some office cubicle after work in London Bridge and talked through issues to the sound of the cleaner hoovering the office floor and cleaning the kitchen. He insisted on putting on this strong electric incense and spent 3 sessions telling me the importance of sleep, urging me to read books on the importance of sleep and forcefully telling me that no one was chaining me to my desk and that I could walk out of work at 5pm. \n\n He clearly did not even attempt to try to understand the nature of my work. \n\n There was a sense of despair as I ended the terrible sessions with him. If that was CBT, I feared I was never going to get better and maybe that was what people meant by having to live with depression. \n\n I gave myself 2 weeks to overcome this particular traumatic event and went back to the GP, requesting a different doctor. This time, the doctor pointed me to a psychiatrist, who then pointed me to a psychologist that she thought could relate to me the most. \n\n She listened, discussed issues with me, gave me suggestions, explained potential treatment methods and explored the methods I was comfortable with. I felt safe enough to share the most vulnerable parts of myself. \n\n Finding the right counsellor / psychologist / psychiatrist is so important. There are different methods, CBT is the most popular one but it's not necessarily the right one for everyone. \n\n The sessions never felt long enough.With my psychologist's guidance, I understood myself better and could start to feel the difference. More of myself, less of the emptiness. \n\n There were moments of “I think I’m okay now” and then a wave of emptiness would hit me so hard that I’m back in that darkness. I was tired of crying, tired of the emptiness and just tired in general. \n\n Both my psychologist and psychiatrist repeatedly offered antidepressants but I said no. \n\n Having understood the problems, the ever - so - stubborn old me felt as if accepting antidepressants would be admitting defeat. I have nothing against antidepressants and know that many people have taken it and have acknowledged its positive effects but given my issues and my personality, it didn't feel right. \n\n After one of my meetings with my psychiatrist who was periodically checking in on me, as I was leaving, she stopped me, looked into my eyes and said, “You know, life shouldn’t be this hard.” \n\n I was taken aback. “Doesn’t everyone live like this ? They just get on with it but I’m just too weak to do so ?” \n\n No, of course not. \n\n I had already been stuck in depression for so long that I thought it was the norm, that it was the base level for everyone. \n\n I still had the preconceived idea that if you have depression, it must be because you’re weak. \n\n Once I felt well enough, I ended my sessions with my psychologist and started to live again. To this day, I often look back and think how incredibly strong I am that I was able to overcome that period of time.And how much stronger it made me by coming through the other end. \n\n Nonetheless, there were still the occasional lows. Commitments I couldn’t follow through, parties I said yes to that I couldn’t get out of bed for, text messages that I left on read for many days at a time. There was guilt but there was also the realisation that I had to live for me, I had to look after my own mental health. \n\n If I had broken a leg, no one would think twice about it. Why would mental health be a problem? \n\n Except I couldn’t really give that as a reason because deep down, I still couldn’t acknowledge it to people. I’m forgiving myself for that and I’m much better at openly talking about my depression now. \n\n Then, the dreaded Covid hit and my carefully constructed life fell apart again. \n\n The depression came back, armed with anxiety and panic attacks this time. With each work email, it got worse. As soon as I sat down at my computer, I would start crying. I would return to that state of having to read an email or document at least 12 times before understanding what it was saying. That’s when I could actually read the screen through my tears. \n\n The anxiety and panic attacks would come out of nowhere. I was so confused. \n\n I wasn’t okay. \n\n So I took medical leave and tried to work through it with my psychologist. \n\n The initial 2 weeks’ leave became 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months... I had my psychologist working with me and my GP checking in on me. Every time I mentioned the possibility of returning to work, they both said no. \n\n Over that period of time, it became abundantly clear to me that the type of lifestyle associated with that type of work was not for me. So I resigned. \n\n The contrast was immediate. \n\n Post-resignation, so many people would compliment me saying I was glowing. I was. My skin was so much better, the shine in my eyes came back, my steps were lighter. I have been so much happier since my resignation. There may still be the occasional low but it's very rare and nowhere near as bad as it used to be. \n\n Is there stigma with mental health? Definitely. \n\n After handing in my notice, the comments I actually heard from colleagues included: “That was a good way to do it, take medical leave, get paid without working and then leave” or a pat on the back for “gaming the system”. \n\n I don't know what are the comments I haven't heard but it doesn't matter. I'm just grateful that I'm alive and feeling alive. \n\n During this mental health awareness week, I hope everyone can be reminded that it's okay to not be okay. Let's all be less harsh on ourselves and remember to love ourselves. \n\n If that's not enough, know that I love you. \n\n Kaycee ❤️"

        body: "October seems to have a special meaning for me. The birthday of everyone I’ve ever seriously dated is in October; the house that I bought completed in October; and, at the point of origin, the little 9-year-old me left China for the UK in October 2003. \n\n October 2003 was such a seismic shift in my life that it’s hard to imagine how my life would have played out had my mother not brought me to the UK. I remember her asking me if I wanted to come with her to England but, even then, I knew it was a question that’s not really a question. If I had been honest, the answer would have been “no”. I had no desire to leave my whole world to travel into the void known as England. \n\n At that time, there was no internet to show me what England was like. I only knew that people abandoned their families to go there, work hard, make money, and supposedly have a better life. Once they get there, they would disintegrate into a monthly voice over the telephone line, a name on an international package and gossip on other people’s tongues. “People” was my mother. I didn’t want to become her. I wanted to stay as flesh and blood, play with my friends, spend time with my grandma, and grow up to be like my cousin. But, of course, when you are asked a non- question, you get a non-choice. Off I go. \n\n On an ordinary Thursday, I got on my first ever long - haul flight to London. On the plane, as the flight attendants passed our food to us, my mother told me I’d have to learn English. I nodded, “好(okay)“. Then, as she taught me how to spread butter on a plain white bread roll, I thought: 不用吧，骗我的吧，世界上几十亿中国人，他们多多少少会说点汉语吧。没事儿(surely not, she must be messing around. There are billions of Chinese people in the world, surely they know how to speak Chinese. It’s fine). \n\n Once we arrived in London, her new, English husband picked us up from the airport and drove us to their home in a cul - de - sac in Luton, Bedfordshire. Everything was lovely but everything was so different. The air smelled different, the roads were missing two lanes at all times, there were no shops around for miles, hardly any high rises, so many more trees, so quiet, so lonely. \n\n On Monday morning, my mother walked me to school. It was so small. Coming from a junior school that had two buildings, each three - storeys tall, with a huge playground in between, I thought this little primary school made of bungalows and huts was super cute. It didn’t take long to get to class but when I did, I froze. Everyone looked so different to me with their blonde hair, blue eyes and white skin. One minute they were talking to each other, the next they were all staring at me. Like a fawn in headlights, I just stood there, eyes wide open, unable to move, nowhere to hide. Strings of what was gibberish to my ears later, I followed the international gesture to sit down. My mouth was dry, vision blurred, but my thoughts were startlingly clear: my mother was right, I had to learn English. \n\n Unleashed onto the colourful little playground, I saw one boy and one girl that were Chinese - looking. I ran up to them to introduce myself to my new friends but they just stared blankly at me as I talked and then ran away. Later I found out that although they were of Chinese ethnicity, they were never taught to speak Chinese. \n\n Maybe it was during these months of my life that shaped my dislike of doing things alone. For at least three months, no words parted from my lips at school, no one sat with me as I had lunch and no one wanted to play with me. I knew that the only solution was to learn English faster so that’s what I did. All of my time after school was dedicated to learning English, copying the Oxford English dictionary and rehearsing sentences. \n\n Around three months later, I began to have light conversations with people and started to make friends. Looking back, I was incredibly lucky to have teachers and support teachers helping me at school and classmates that were friendly and tried to help me whenever they could, with or without me knowing. \n\n But now that I could understand what people were saying, I began to hear the racial slurs too, from teenagers and adults alike. They thought shouting “ching chang chong”, “chink”, “chinky”, “go back home” at me was funny. \n\n I didn't understand the humour. I was 10 years old.  \n\n With the racial slurs, my internalised racism began to insidiously slip in. I thought that maybe if I was more like the English folks around me, these comments would go away so I worked tirelessly to perfect my British accent and started eating sandwiches for lunch instead of Chinese food. Then I went on to actively ditch all my knowledge of the Chinese language and refused to learn about Chinese history and culture. Much later, in my late teenage years, I started to use skin whitening cream, light coloured foundations, and heavy eyeliners. Thankfully the emo and goth look was in fashion back then. \n\n And, of course, to the big, scary question of “Where are you from ?”, I angrily answered “Here, Luton”. \n\n Not only did myself have such a strong opinion as to where I’m from. Other people did too. Growing up, despite telling people that I was Chinese, there were plenty of people that disagreed and insisted that I was actually Korean, or Japanese, or maybe I was mixed race. They seemed to know where I was going too. They were absolutely certain that Oxford and Cambridge would be fighting over me because Chinese people are really clever(plot spoiler: they didn't). \n\n In parallel with my internalised racism, I was beginning to find that I had feelings for women. My sexual awakening started when I was about 13 years old with the film Saving Face. This was the age of Limewire, Pirate Bay and illegally downloading and sharing films. My mother had received a CD with a bunch of films on it from her friend, one of which was Saving Face. \n\n I watched it and kept watching it, over and over and over again. For the longest time, I didn’t know why I liked it so much. I didn’t have the vocabulary for how I was feeling, in neither Chinese nor English. So I searched online and educated myself. Aha, I was gay. But once I learned the term “gay”, I also became aware of its negative connotations. “Ew, that’s so gay”, “同性恋是一种病(being gay is an illness)”, etc. Tumblr also suggested that “coming out” could be dangerous, especially with Asian families who held traditional values. I thought about my family. They were not extremely traditional but they weren’t exactly spearheading liberal values either and since I had no one else to turn to about this, I batted my feelings into a black hole and worked on my internalised racism instead. \n\n It was only in my early 20s that I started to embrace the mix of my Chinese heritage, my British upbringing, and my sexuality. I taught myself Chinese again and started to learn more about Chinese culture and history. I accepted that I was gay and was terrified of “coming out” to my mum(but eventually I did). I deeply understood that British queer East and Southeast Asians(ESEAs) face a particular set of challenges with respect to their heritage and sexuality.  \n\n Fast forward to today, we are still not seeing queer ESEAs being adequately represented in mainstream media. We are still faced with the trepidation and doubt of “coming out” to our families. We are, undoubtedly, a part of British society yet when we see displays of queer history, we rarely see people that look like us and often walk away with the sense that it’s their history, not ours. \n\n That’s why I wanted to start this initiative. I want to: \n\n Build a wider community, offering a space online and offline to discover, support and promote each other. \n\n Be more present so that we can have a better, more comprehensive representation of the British East and Southeast Asian Queer Community. \n\n Produce an archive of British East and Southeast Asian queer history, starting from now."
